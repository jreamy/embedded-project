# Contains code written to test various aspect of the final project code

## ADC
The ADC folder was used to adapt an old adc driver to conform to the register / unregister callback protocol.  The off by 1 error persists, but is corrected in the final project folder.

## Data_Com
The Data_Com folder is the first draft of the code written to run on the arduino.  It's very out of date, but preserved for posterity.

## I2C_com
The I2C com folder was used to develop the I2C -> Serial protocol whereby the I2C hardware can be simulated (incorporated into the final project folder).
